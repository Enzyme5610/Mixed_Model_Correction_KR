# Mixed Model Correction

Browser-based tool for testing treatment effects on physiology or qPCR data
with a linear mixed model, accounting for Line and Batch variability.
Includes pairwise comparisons and downloadable plots. No installation needed.
Data is local to your platform (PC/Mac/Linux).

**App:** https://enzyme5610.github.io/Mixed_Model_Correction_KR/

## How to use

1. Upload a CSV (format below).
2. Check the parameter list. Numeric columns are preselected; unselect any
   that aren't parameters (e.g. age, culture days, well number).
3. Choose the pairwise adjustment (Tukey or Bonferroni).
4. Click **Run models**, then download results, pairwise tables and plots.

The first load takes about 30 seconds while R loads in the browser.

## CSV format

One row per measurement, with columns named exactly `Tx`, `Line` and
`Batch` (any position), plus one column per parameter:

```
Tx,Line,Batch,GRIA1,GAD1
Control,L1,B1,4.21,6.10
Control,L1,B2,4.35,6.02
AD,L5,B1,5.02,7.44
```

- **Line:** one label per actual cell line.
- **Batch:** numbered within each line (L1's first batch is B1).
- **qPCR:** enter ΔCt values. Average technical replicates or enter each as
  its own row.

## Model

`parameter ~ Tx + (1 | Line/Batch)`, fit with `lmerTest::lmer`, with Tx
tested by a Type II F test using Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom. With one
Line the model uses `(1 | Batch)`; with one Batch, or one row per line and
batch, `(1 | Line)`. Pairwise comparisons use `emmeans`.

## Plots

Dots, bars or violins showing each sample, with error bars as the model's
95% CI or SE, or the raw SEM or SD (caps, direction and mean marker are
adjustable). The Y axis can show values as entered, relative to a reference group (linear
data, e.g. physiology), or as fold change 2^-ΔΔCt (ΔCt data, qPCR).
Statistics always use the values as entered.
